# UVVU

The Unexpectedly Very VUlnerable web application is written in Node.js using the Express framework. It comes with a configuration file that allows to define if each vulnerability is exploitable or not.
Some vulnerabilities also come with different levels of difficulties like the command injection. It is worth noting that this application is poorly design on purpose to mimic real
case scenarios of dangerous vulnerabilities, it should then be executed in a sandbox environment.

# Install

To install required node modules run `npm install`

Then just run the script `run.sh`
